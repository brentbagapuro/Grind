#GRIND website

This is an SPA for Grind Fitness & Strength Training Studio. This website displays the gym's info and call-to-action, with the goal to encourage viewers to submit a form for membership enrollment.

This project was not meant for public use but is for employment purposes, in which this project will be displayed on my portfolio website for interested employers to see and judge my skills in HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, and Responsive design.
